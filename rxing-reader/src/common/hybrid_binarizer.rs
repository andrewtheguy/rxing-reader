/// This is slower than [`GlobalHistogramBinarizer`] but handles high-frequency
/// barcode images with black data on white backgrounds more robustly. It is designed for
/// high frequency images of barcodes with black data on white backgrounds. For this application,
/// it does a much better job than a global blackpoint with severe shadows and gradients.
/// However it tends to produce artifacts on lower frequency images and is therefore not
/// a good general purpose binarizer for uses outside ZXing.

/// It wraps [`GlobalHistogramBinarizer`], using the older histogram approach for 1D readers
